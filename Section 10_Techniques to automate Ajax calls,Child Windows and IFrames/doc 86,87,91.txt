 The Selenium WebDriver's Advanced User Interactions API allows us to perform operations from
keyboard events and simple mouse events to complex events such as dragging-and-dropping,
holding a key and then performing mouse operations by using the Actions class, and building
a complex chain of events exactly like a user doing these manually.
The Actions class implements the builder pattern to create a composite action containing a
group of other actions

We need to create an instance of the Actions class by passing the instance of driver class
to the constructor in the following way:
Actions builder = new Actions(driver);

HTML frames allow developers to present documents in multiple views, which may be
independent windows or subwindows. Multiple views offer developers a way to keep certain
information visible, while other views are scrolled or replaced. For example, within the same
window, one frame might display a static banner, the second a navigation menu, and the third
the main document that can be scrolled through or replaced by navigating in the second frame.
